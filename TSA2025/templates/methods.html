                    Responsible Waste Management
                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    Minimizing waste is a core part of our mission. Any food scraps from our kitchen are composted to enrich local soil, helping to grow the next generation of fresh ingredients. Additionally, leftover produce that is still safe for consumption is donated to nearby animal shelters, providing nutritious treats for rescued animals. Through these efforts, we ensure that nothing goes to waste, creating a closed-loop system that benefits both the planet and our community.
